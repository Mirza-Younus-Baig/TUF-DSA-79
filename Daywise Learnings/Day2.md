Day 8 - Java & DSA Wrap-Up

âœ… Key Topics Covered

1. Two Sum Problem (Python)
	â€¢	Learned how to find pairs in a list that sum to a target using the two-pointer technique.
	â€¢	Optimized by sorting and maintaining a map of values to indices to retrieve original positions.

ðŸ”¹ Example:

arr = [2, 4, 5, 1, 3]
target = 6
# Result: [[1, 3], [2, 4]] for pairs [5, 1], [3, 3] based on original indices

2. Three Sum Problem (Java)
	â€¢	Implemented optimal O(n^2) solution using two-pointer approach.
	â€¢	Handled duplicate elements to ensure unique triplets.
	â€¢	Converted a working solution into a complete class with test cases in main.

ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts:
	â€¢	Sort the array
	â€¢	Fix one index and use two pointers to find the other two
	â€¢	Skip duplicates using while loops

ðŸ”¹ Example Test Case:

Input: [-5, 2, 3, 0, -2, 1, 4, -1]
Output: [[-5, 1, 4], [-5, 2, 3], [-2, -1, 3], [-2, 0, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]

3. Matrix in Java
	â€¢	Declared and accessed 2D arrays
	â€¢	Built a custom Matrix class concept with methods like transpose(), add(), and print()

ðŸ”¹ Syntax:

int[][] matrix = new int[3][3];
matrix[0][1] = 5;


â¸»

4. ArrayList and List Interface
	â€¢	Used ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> to create dynamic 2D lists
	â€¢	Compared List (interface) vs ArrayList (implementation)

ðŸ”¹ Dynamic 2D Array:

ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> matrix = new ArrayList<>();
matrix.add(new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2)));
matrix.add(new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(3, 4)));


â¸»

ðŸ§  Reinforced Concepts
	â€¢	Java collection APIs (List, ArrayList, Arrays.asList())
	â€¢	Two-pointer algorithm
	â€¢	Sorting + Duplicate skipping
	â€¢	Matrix structure in Java
	â€¢	Writing readable, testable Java code

â¸»

âœ… Next Suggestions:
	â€¢	Add support for 3Sum with custom target
	â€¢	Implement matrix methods: multiplication, identity check
	â€¢	Try sliding window and hashmap-based problems
